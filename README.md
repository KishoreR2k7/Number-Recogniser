# Number Recogniser

A simple Machine Learning / Deep Learning web app to recognize handwritten numbers.

This project consists of two parts:

1. A backend model (trained in Python) for digit recognition.  
2. A frontend (hosted on Hugging Face Spaces) for interacting with the model — allowing users to draw a digit and get predictions.

## Features

- Accepts user drawn input (digit) via a web interface  
- Predicts which digit (0–9) the drawing represents  
- Uses a trained neural network model (`.h5`)  
- Fast inference in-browser via the hosted frontend

## Installation (for local setup)

To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KishoreR2k7/Number-Recogniser.git
   cd Number-Recogniser
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your browser at http://localhost:7860 (or whatever port the app uses) to try it out.

Usage
Draw a digit (0-9) in the provided canvas on the front end.

Click Predict (or similar) to get the model’s output.

The model outputs the predicted digit along with a confidence score.

Contributing
Contributions are very welcome! Here are some ways to help:

Improve model accuracy (try different architectures, more data)

Clean up / refactor code

Add more features: e.g. support for multi-digit input, or drawing with touch / mobile devices

Add tests

If you have suggestions or find bugs, feel free to open an issue or send a pull request.
